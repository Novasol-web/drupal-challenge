# Task for back end developers for NOVASOL

As a user I want to see list of properties in a page that are available so I can know what properties could be booked. Fetch data from Mock.

Deliverable:
A Drupal 8 module. The property listing should have pagination to see more properties. It should be possible to filter the properties with from/to dates(Date format accepted by API - Ymd. Both ‘from’ and ‘to’ parameter values are required)
The module should contain what you consider best practices in drupal when it comes to fetching the data, presenting them through drupal's theming system, along with tests covering the different parts.
Using Drupal's DIC, Guzzle, PHPUnit etc.
